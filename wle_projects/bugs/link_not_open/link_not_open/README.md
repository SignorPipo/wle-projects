# Overview

Template project for the [Wonderland Engine](https://wonderlandengine.com/).

The project includes the [PP library](https://github.com/SignorPipo/wle_pp).

A collection of assets that can be useful while working with the Wonderland Engine (like gamepads 3D models) can be found [here](https://github.com/SignorPipo/wle_assets).

There are a few versions of this template:
- [`wle_ppefault`](https://github.com/SignorPipo/wle_ppefault/tree/main/wle_ppefault/wle_ppefault)
  * a standard project (not `npm`)
  * the PP library is included as a bundle file
- [`wle_ppefault_npm`](https://github.com/SignorPipo/wle_ppefault/tree/main/wle_ppefault/wle_ppefault_npm)

# Scene Structure

In the scene you will find only a few objects that should make it easier and faster to get started with the development, without adding too many things you may have to delete.

The scene is composed by a `Scene` object that contains a `Player` and two `Lights`.

The `Scene` object has the following components on it:
- `pp-get-player-objects`
  * get all the objects related to the player and put them in a global variable `PP.myPlayerObjects`
- `pp-get-default-resources`
  * get some engine resources (meshes, materials) and put them in a global variable `PP.myDefaultResources` to make them easily accessible in the code
- `pp-input-manager`
  * creates and updates the input devices like the gamepads, the mouse and the keyboard
  * creates some global variables like `PP.myMouse` or `PP.myGamepads` to easily access these devices
- `pp-visual-manager`
  * creates and updates a global visual manager that can be accessed through the variable `PP.myVisualManager`
- `pp-debug-manager`
  * creates and updates a global debug manager that can be accessed through the variable `PP.myDebugManager`

The `Player` object includes:
- `Pivot`
  * can be used to offset the head and the hands, for example to have a specific height
  * the pivot includes the `pp-player-height` component disabled, you can enable it to set a specific height from the floor
  * if `local-floor` is enabled, the `pp-player-height` component will automatically stop, so that the height will be the real one of the user
- `Non VR Camera`
  * used to render the view when you have not entered the VR session yet
- `Eyes`
  * used to render the VR view
- `Hands`
  * follow the gamepads/tracked hands positions
  * the gamepads are displayed as two Meta Quest gamepads that are animated, that means buttons react when pressed in real life
  * the tracked hands are displayed through cubes positioned on the tracked hand joints
  * includes `pp-console-vr` and 'pp-easy-tune`, two tools that can be useful while debugging and tuning
- `Head`
  * follows the head of the player
  * includes a `pp-spatial-audio-listener` component
